This is a project I created for my last year bachelors major project.

This project is called QR code based Covid check in.

When there was the time of  covid-19 pandemic, social distancing is very important. It is not safe to use the public registers or pens to write the check-in/check-out details in a public place.

To avoid the use of public materials and rush, here proposed a QR code based software.

The software generates a unique QR code to every user and can use this QR code anywhere as an identification code.

This QR code can be used to check-in into a business firm. 

At the moment of scanning QR code, the software records the check-in time, check-out time, location and personal details such as, name, address, mobile number etc. 

Thus, the system avoids the public contact and queues at entrance in the public places.
